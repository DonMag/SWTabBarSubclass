# SWTabBarSubclass

Simple example of sub-classing UITabBarController to allow calling functions when Tabs are selected (such as resetting a view controller's scrollView position).

Note: This is just an example of setting up for a custom UITabBarController. When the app runs, it will look like a standard tab bar app. The only thing that will show a difference is the debug console where the `print()` statements output.
